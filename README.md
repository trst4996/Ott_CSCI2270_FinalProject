# Ott_CSCI2270_FinalProject

This project will go off of assignment 12. It will have all of assignment 12's functionalities. The special thing it will do is give the user an option to use different hash functions and track the number of collisions occuring as items are added. 

# Problems

Right now I want to read everything into a linked list in order so that we can print it in order, I haven't listed that as a functionality of the program because I can't get it to work. I'm working on it though, should be able to giet that working soon.

I guess my find function doesn't work, not entirely sure why. This affects the delete function also

# Dependancies

Thinking of including the movie names text file in order to show different collisions in the hash table when using different functions. 
For now, nothing extra is needed. 

# Credit

Got some info on hash functions from this website, very helphul

Also got some help using the linked list from Michael Catchen.
